## Testing
This web was made for Iphone 4 screen size (320px x 480px) and to desktop screen size (1920px x1080px).
While I was testing and preview the site, I had a bug that 2 of the images where not showing and the path were well written. The problem was that the "alt" section had the text written with spaces in the middle and not "-".

## Validator Testing
- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- CSS
    - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

## Unfixed Bugs
When you select over one of the nav items, it shakes because the padding and width changes
